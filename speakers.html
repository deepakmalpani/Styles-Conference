                    <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers</h5>
                    <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of
                        well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It&#8217;s the filmmaker
                        &#8217;s job to put this together. To do so they&#8217;ve developed processes, tools
                        and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow
                        and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</p>
                    <p>With this workshop, we&#8217;ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and
                        expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217;ll look at
                        some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards.
                        We&#8217;ll consider why they&#8217;re used and how we might look to them for
                        inspiration.</p>
                    <h5>About Adam</h5>

            <h5>What Designers Can Learn from Parenting</h5>
            <p>That first client meeting may not feel as warm and fulfilling as the first time you hold your
                newborn child, but consider the similarities.</p>
            <p>You know each other but have never met. As the relationship grows you will have to rely on your
                experiences and education to gently guide them while allowing flexibility for projects to
                change and evolve. It&#8217;s not your job to control everything, but if you are successful
                you will create a well-rounded piece that everyone involved can love.</p>
            <h5>About Jennifer</h5>
             <p>Jennifer Jones is an event coordinator for the WebVisions Conference and also co-authors a blog with her teenage daughter. She and her family live in Portland, Oregon where she balances work, parenting and any other life challenge with honesty, humor and liquor.</p>
